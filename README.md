# hello-world
Write a short description.

I'd like to go to Mars but the flight takes two years!
Besides, it's a pretty lifeless rock from what I've seen in photographs.
The only so-called 'evidence' for life there appears to all be fake.
Even the stuff that could be real is too grainy in the photos to tell for sure.
Maybe not that much of a destination after all.
